                "This is a notebook containing calculated heating needs and costs for the Neds Housing Cooperative. The purpose of this document and the accompanying code files is to allow us to be as accurate and well informed as possible when making decisions about how to heat our home. This includes giving us the option to model different scenarios in the future down to fine, granular detail. For example, we want to be able to model scenarios in which some people are working from home, and need their rooms at $20 C$ during the day. Or, we want to be able to work out how much we'd pay if we have a heating pump in the main house, but haven't finished insulating. \r\n",
                "\r\n",
                "I've built up this as a fairly simple, but hopefully comprehensive toolkit. It's structured such that this document ought to be readable by anyone. All of the main code used for calculations is in `main.py`, and I've tried to comment these things. The functions for getting weather data are stored in `weather.py` but, as I say, probably no one needs to inspect that. \r\n",

                "1. First is that I don't know how to model the heat loss due to vents. This is easily amended, but currently they're included as fixed offsets.\r\n",
                "2. The U values for the house building materials are not accurate. These are sourced from generic online sources, and ought to be *roughly* correct, but they're not from the datasheets of our actual materials (as opposed to the $U$ values for the flat, which I believe are correct. )\r\n",
                "3. The measurements for the house are also estimates, but these are less likely to be accurate. The flat measurements are actual measurements however.\r\n",
                "4. While this outputs a pdf, there's nothing difficult about updating some of the values and making things more accurate. This should be seen not as a finished report but as a template usage for a tool which I hope will be useful to Neds in the longer term. \r\n",

The first is that we might have innaccurate models of $U$ values and measurements etc, but moreimportantly I think we might struggle to accurately model how much people heat their rooms, and to what temperatures. The below calculations, then, should be seen as guidelines for what we would expect to pay to heat the house in a particular way, rather than a re-creation of how we might have heated it in the past.
