The purpose of this document and the accompanying code files is to allow us to be as accurate and well informed as possible when making decisions about how to heat our home. This will serve two main functions:\n",

                "Using a computational document like this has a couple of advantages; for example, we can update some particular values about the house, or generate projections, without much work at all. The drawbacks are that it is less user accessible than other options. I've tried to split functionality so that anyone can use / read this document, but also that it's easy to adjust the projections and numbers etc. \n",
