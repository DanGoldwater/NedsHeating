    "# Neds Rent Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "The current formula we have is as follows:\n",
    "> Base level rent is £46 per week. Members pay an extra £1 per week in rent for every £3,000 earned in a year over £14,200 after tax Members shall pay an extra £1 a week in rent when their level of savings, investments and/or property exceed £14,200, plus an additional £1 per week for each additional £3,000 thereafter. This figure should be revised each year based on the following formula: Annual income based on working 35 hours a week at the national living wage (recommended by the Living Wage Foundation) minus tax paid based on the current personal tax allowance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggest that we have the following problems:\n",
    "- Rent is not scaled 'fast' enough; higher contributions ought to kick in at a different rate for higher earners\n",
    "- Bills are not scaled currently. This is not equitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scale the rent differently:  \n",
    "- Low earners see no change in their rent payments\n",
    "- High earners pay more\n",
    "- Cap of 1.5 x stays in place\n",
    "- We have a discussion of what 'fixed costs' are\n",
    "- If all on low income, we still meet our mortgage needs (as is the case now)\n",
    "- If someone leaves, joins, increases or decreases their income; only *that* person needs to change their rent payments (as is the case now). \n",
    "- We accumulate more surplus\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scale the bills differently:\n",
    "- The total amount we pay, between us, stays the same.\n",
    "- We divide this amount up in a way which is *similar* to the way I am proposing we divide up the bills.\n",
    "- If someone leaves, joins, increases or decreases their income; other housemates *might* need to adjust their bills contributions. \n",
    "- High earning housemates would see their bills increase\n",
    "- Low earning housemates would see their bills *decrease*\n",
